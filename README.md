# Boilerplate: Svelte 5 Static Auth w/SupaBase + Google OAuth

Boilerplate code for integrating client-side authorization in SvelteKit 5 w/Email (SupaBase) and Google OAuth.

Includes:
- Shadcn-svelte for UI
- Superforms + Zod
- Tailwindcss 3

## Install

Clone the repo, then:

```bash
# install node dependencies
npm install

# start up dev server
npm run dev
```

## Notes

Used Tailwindcss 3 (instead of 4) due to Shadcn-svelte not seeming to play nice with Tailwindcss 4. Once resolved, should update to Tailwindcss 4.
